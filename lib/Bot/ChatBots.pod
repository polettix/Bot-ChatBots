=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Bot::ChatBots;
   # more will come, possibly in sub-modules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bot::ChatBots family of modules aim to help setting up ChatBots in
different technologies.

The basic model (still somehow in a state of flux) is an extension of
L<Data::Tubes>, with a few differences:

=over

=item *

pipelines in L<Data::Tubes> are usually assumed to know where to take
their inputs and aim at processing all of it as fast as possible, while in
this case the it generally comes asynchronously and over an indefinite
length of time. This means that the sources of records are usually coded
differently and then push records inside pipelines as they arrive;

=item *

processing in L<Data::Tubes> is generally synchronous for simplicity,
while in this case you might have longer running tasks. This can be
addressed in different ways, one of which might be to split your pipeline
into chunks, and decouple these chunks via some queuing mechanism.

=back

Apart from this, the suggested way to use Bot::ChatBots elements is
sticking to the L<Data::Tubes> way of work: define your pipelines, reuse
already-available tube builders or code your own adhering to the (simple)
tube interface.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Report bugs either GitHub (patches welcome).

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Bot::ChatBots::Telegram> should be the first implementation of a backend (for
Telegram).
